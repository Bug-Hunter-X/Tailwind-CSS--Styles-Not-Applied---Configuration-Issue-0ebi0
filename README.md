# Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue: Styles Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS fails to pick up styles from components despite seemingly correct setup.  The problem stems from the `content` array in the Tailwind CSS configuration file.  This is often due to incorrect file path specifications or exclusion of the relevant source files.

## Problem

Even with the correct Tailwind directives in place, styles are not getting applied.  This is despite ensuring the necessary configuration settings appear accurate.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully verifying the contents of the `content` array in the Tailwind configuration. Make sure the paths to your components are specified correctly, and that you include all necessary file extensions.
